The goal of `rockup` is to make it easy to connect to R Studio Server
via [rocker](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker).

## Installation instructions

Install the development version of `rockup` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/rytenlab/rockup) with:

``` r
BiocManager::install("rytenlab/rockup")
```

## Basic usage

`rockup` has a single user-level function
[docker_run_rserver](https://rytenlab.github.io/rockup/reference/docker_run_rserver.html),
which is designed to start a container running R Studio Server on a
[rocker](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker). Below is an example of
how to run `docker_run_rserver` with minimal config, for a more detailed
guide see the
[vignette](https://rytenlab.github.io/rockup/articles/rockup.html).

``` r
docker_run_rserver(
  image = "bioconductor/bioconductor_docker:RELEASE_3_13",
  port = 8888,
  name = "your_container_name"
)
```
